<h2>About the Potter, Rhiain Nathanson</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/rhiain.jpg" class="r">
<p>In 2010, Rhiain&apos;s life-long passion for stoneware and ceramics led her to securing an apprenticeship with the celebrated master potter Ray Finch at Winchcombe Pottery in Gloucestershire. Internationally admired for work that expresses the more traditional values of craft, the expert training Rhiain received there was fundamental to her development of techniques and personal style. Specializing in exquisite wood fired cone ten-reduction stoneware, the two intensive years at Winchcombe saw her becoming a production potter; able to throw her whole standard range.</p>
<p>After Ray Finch&apos;s passing, Rhiain took over management of the workshop alongside Ray&apos;s son, Mike Finch. Among her responsibilities of building the wood fired kiln and utilising various glazing and firing methods, she also gave informed advice to visitors and conducted sales accordingly. Increased faith in her capacities meant Rhiain was able to train a new potter in the multitude of tasks required to keep a pottery running smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Another position as a technician at Landsdown Pottery &ndash; part of The Waldorf College Group &ndash; involved providing further education and training to adults with learning difficulties in a creative environment. Rhiain not only supported students and staff with technical issues, but had the chance to teach the throwing of pots in a holistic manner; the journey from the beginning with crude clay. Furthermore, she added to her repertoire by producing their line of products.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges presented, Rhiain thoroughly appreciated her association with Lansdown Pottery. The pottery also supports the local community and gives participants the chance to experience weekly workshops. Considering her view of pottery as a way of connecting hands-on work with the world around us, assisting students &ndash; sometimes with acute disabilities &ndash; to express themselves, and create both functional and handsome work, was inspirational.</p>

<h2>About the Pottery</h2>

<blockquote>
	<p>My work predominantly comprises of functional forms &ndash; bowls, mugs, jugs and tea sets &ndash; as well as more individual studio pieces including vases, Chawans and Yunomis.</p>
	<p>The intimacy and accuracy of potting that throwing can achieve is extremely important to me: it allows me the means there through to express myself. The pot must feel right, look comfortable within itself, and also fulfil its ultimate function.</p>
	<p>I love to inspire people to cook good food and enjoy it from beautiful pots; I love to cook myself and the application of my ceramics plays a large role in the design of my pots. I especially enjoy drinking my morning coffee out of a different mug each day. </p>
	<p>I am currently producing cone-six, oxidised stoneware; developing new glazes; and generally expanding my experience of firing within an oxidised environment.</p>
	<p>Previously having worked with wood-fired reduction-ware, I felt a stronger connection to the pots and their interaction with the world around us as the production cycle was renewable; after firing the wood ash would be collected and made into the next batch of glaze. This is something that I am keen to explore further.</p>
